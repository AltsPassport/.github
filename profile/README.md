# AltsPassport

**The AI-powered growth platform for alternative fund managers, allocators, and providers.**

AltsPassport is building an AI-powered vertical market network for alternative investments — starting with fund managers — by combining alternatives-specific data, workflow software, and explainable scoring/matching to make capital formation more intelligent, efficient, and trustable.

---

## What we optimize for

- **Built for alternatives:** domain-specific workflows and signal, not generic CRM.
- **Workflow-native:** designed for daily fundraising execution, not static lists.
- **Trust layer:** provenance and explainability for signals and recommendations.
- **Conflict-free:** no commissions or revenue shares that bias outcomes.
