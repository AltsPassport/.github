# AltsPassport

**Simplified fundraising. Built for alternatives.**  
**The AI-powered growth platform for alternative fund managers.**

## What we are building
AltsPassport is building an AI-powered vertical market network for alternative investments—starting with fund managers—by combining alternatives-specific data, workflow software, and explainable scoring/matching to make capital formation more intelligent, efficient, and trustable.

## What we optimize for
- **Built for alternatives**: domain-specific workflows and signal, not generic CRM.
- **Workflow-native**: designed for daily fundraising execution (not static lists).
- **Trust layer**: provenance and explainability for signals and recommendations.
- **Conflict-free**: no commissions or revenue shares that bias outcomes.

## Where we are
We are in active build mode. This GitHub organization is the long-term source of truth for AltsPassport product development and operating assets. Public content here will remain high-signal and evergreen.
